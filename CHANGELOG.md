# Container distribution (unreleased)

- Include the official Gatearr logo as the default brand image; custom portal names and logos remain configurable.
- Add tested GHCR publication for AMD64 and ARM64, stable version tags and a separate development channel.
- Use a published container in deployment Compose, with an explicit source-build override and data-preserving update instructions.

# Changes

## 2026-10-16 — Unified Gatearr portal

- English is the only bundled language. Additional languages and all text are managed on one translation page per language.
- Media API keys are required in the setup wizard and stored encrypted; removed environment-based API configuration and installation tokens.
- Gatearr naming throughout the source, containers, database and cookies. Upgrade instructions preserve existing data volumes and encryption keys.
- Numbered setup breadcrumbs. Completed installations use API connections instead of a persistent wizard entry.
- Separate Branding, Emails, Services and Users pages, plus consistent prominent back buttons throughout administration.
- Cached authenticated connection health, green/red indicators, keyboard-accessible hover details and manual refresh.
- Customizable button hover color, including draft and published themes.
- Per-user Seerr/Tracearr status indicators only when the relevant connector is configured and enabled.
- One account language for the interface, email delivery and Seerr settings, with retry/verification. Tracearr's client-only language limitation is stated explicitly.
- Emby library permissions use virtual-folder GUIDs rather than numeric navigation IDs, preserve unrelated policy and verify the write.
- Existing features retained: PNG uploads, WYSIWYG mail, nested device guides, portal blocks, secure email verification/reset, roles and media user cloning.
